In the current codebase, I am developing a cross-platform 3DAIGC application. Now I need you to support user management based on the current codebase.
Specifically, noe we are two variants of the backend services, enable/disable user management. If it's disabled, all clients can see all historical jobs from all clients, and job submission does not require any API token, so you don't need to do anything from current codebase. If it's enabled, user can only see the jobs they submitted/requested, and need to first register/login before querying jobs or submit jobs. You can get whether user auth is enabled via @dev_history/ui_management/auth_check.md 
If it's enabled, I hope you can add two minimal components/pages for the user to register and login, and later all job polling/submission should be done with the generated token. Examples of register/login/get token  are provided at @dev_history/ui_management/auth_api.md 
You are an expert, make good plans before you begin, and only modify necessary code. Don't create ANY markdown files.

When the user login, perhaps you should clear the local cache which may belong to another user? (or verify whether it belongs to the login user). You should also address the anonymous backend mode.
